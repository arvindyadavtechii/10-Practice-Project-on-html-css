    <h3>Early Life and Background</h3>
    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal. He is the youngest of four children born to Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man. Ronaldo’s middle name, “Ronaldo,” was inspired by Ronald Reagan, a former U.S. President whom his father admired.
        Ronaldo grew up in humble circumstances. His family lived in a small, tin-roofed house in Santo António, a working-class neighborhood of Funchal. Despite financial struggles, Ronaldo’s passion for football was evident from a young age.

        <h2>Solar System</h2>
        <p>The solar system is a vast and intricate collection of celestial bodies bound together by the gravitational pull of the Sun, which lies at its center. It consists of eight planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—each orbiting the Sun in nearly elliptical paths, along with their moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, meteoroids, and interplanetary dust. The solar system spans an area approximately 100,000 astronomical units (AU) in diameter, with the outermost boundary marked by the Oort Cloud, a spherical region of icy bodies. At its heart, the Sun provides the energy and gravitational stability necessary for the system's balance. The inner planets, or terrestrial planets, are rocky and closer to the Sun, while the outer planets, or gas and ice giants, are massive and have extensive ring systems and numerous moons. The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter contains countless rocky remnants from the early solar system, while beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, home to icy bodies like Pluto. The solar system also interacts with the interstellar environment, with the heliosphere, a bubble-like region of solar wind, marking its boundary. Formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from a collapsing molecular cloud, the solar system continues to evolve, shaped by dynamic processes such as planetary migration, collisions, and gravitational interactions. It serves as a diverse laboratory for understanding the origins and mechanics of planetary systems and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

        <h2>Sun</h2>
        <p>The Sun is the massive, glowing star at the center of our solar system, playing a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth and governing the dynamics of the surrounding celestial bodies. Composed primarily of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%), with trace amounts of heavier elements, the Sun is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma powered by nuclear fusion. This fusion process occurs in its core, where immense pressure and temperatures of approximately 15 million degrees Celsius enable hydrogen atoms to combine into helium, releasing an enormous amount of energy in the form of light and heat. The Sun's surface, or photosphere, has a temperature of about 5,500 degrees Celsius and emits the sunlight that illuminates and warms our planet. Surrounding the photosphere is the corona, a tenuous outer layer visible during solar eclipses, with temperatures exceeding 1 million degrees Celsius. The Sun's immense gravitational pull holds the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets of the solar system in their orbits, while its magnetic field drives phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. With a diameter of approximately 1.39 million kilometers, it accounts for over 99.8% of the solar system's total mass, making it the central force shaping our cosmic neighborhood. Its life cycle as a star is currently in the stable "main sequence" phase, with an expected total lifespan of about 10 billion years, of which approximately 4.6 billion years have passed.</p>

        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system and the one closest to the Sun, making it a fascinating yet extreme world. With a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon and lacks a substantial atmosphere, resulting in dramatic temperature variations. Daytime temperatures on Mercury's surface can soar to approximately 430°C (800°F), while nighttime temperatures plummet to nearly -180°C (-290°F) due to its inability to retain heat. Its surface is heavily cratered and ancient, resembling the Moon, with features such as the massive Caloris Basin and extensive smooth plains. Mercury's proximity to the Sun means it completes an orbit in just 88 Earth days, but its rotation is slow; a single day on Mercury (sunrise to sunrise) lasts about 176 Earth days. The planet's core, which is unusually large relative to its size, is thought to be composed mostly of iron and nickel, contributing to a weak but detectable magnetic field. Mercury's lack of significant atmosphere means it has no weather or wind to erode its surface, preserving a record of impacts dating back billions of years. Observations of Mercury are challenging due to its closeness to the Sun, but missions like NASA's MESSENGER and ESA's BepiColombo have provided valuable insights into its geology, composition, and history, revealing a world that, despite its size, plays a key role in understanding planetary formation and evolution.</p>

    <section class="texta1">
        <h2>Venus</h2>
        <p>Venus, often called Earth’s “twin” due to its similar size and composition, is a mysterious and hostile planet that orbits the Sun as the second planet in our solar system. With a diameter of approximately 12,104 kilometers, Venus is slightly smaller than Earth, but its thick, toxic atmosphere sets it apart. This dense atmosphere, composed mostly of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid, creates a runaway greenhouse effect, trapping heat and making Venus the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures averaging around 475°C (900°F). The atmospheric pressure on Venus is about 92 times that of Earth’s, equivalent to being nearly a kilometer underwater. 

            Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, a phenomenon known as retrograde rotation, and has an extremely slow rotation period; a single day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days, longer than its year of 225 Earth days. Its surface, obscured by thick clouds, has been mapped using radar and reveals a landscape of vast plains, volcanic features, and deformed plateaus. Evidence of volcanic activity suggests Venus may still be geologically active. Venus lacks a significant magnetic field, likely due to its slow rotation, and its surface is marked by vast lava flows and impact craters.
            
            Often visible from Earth as a bright "morning" or "evening star," Venus has been a focus of fascination and study for centuries. Missions like NASA's Magellan and ESA's Venus Express, as well as future missions like NASA's VERITAS, aim to unravel its secrets, including the possibility of past habitability before its climate became so extreme. Despite its beauty when viewed from afar, Venus serves as a cautionary tale about the effects of unchecked greenhouse gases..</p>

        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known world to support life, making it a unique and extraordinary celestial body in the solar system. With a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers, it is the fifth-largest planet and the largest of the terrestrial planets. Earth's surface is about 71% water, earning it the nickname "the Blue Planet," with vast oceans playing a crucial role in regulating its climate and supporting a diverse biosphere. Its atmosphere, composed primarily of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with traces of other gases, provides the air we breathe and shields the planet from harmful solar radiation.

            Earth's internal structure consists of a solid inner core, a liquid outer core that generates a protective magnetic field, a viscous mantle, and a thin outer crust. This dynamic structure drives plate tectonics, shaping continents, forming mountains, and triggering volcanic activity. The planet's surface features a stunning variety of landscapes, from lush forests and sprawling deserts to icy poles and deep ocean trenches. Earth's axial tilt of 23.5 degrees gives rise to seasons, while its 24-hour rotation defines the day-night cycle, and its orbit around the Sun, completed in 365.25 days, defines the year.
            
            Earth's moderate temperatures, abundant liquid water, and stable climate are maintained by the greenhouse effect and its distance from the Sun, within the "habitable zone." The planet is home to millions of species, from microscopic organisms to complex multicellular life forms, with humans playing a dominant role in shaping its ecosystems and geology. Earth's natural satellite, the Moon, stabilizes its axial tilt, influences tides, and has been integral to the planet's history. As humanity explores the cosmos, Earth remains our home, a vibrant and interconnected system teeming with life and unparalleled beauty..</p>

    <section class="texta1">
        <h2>Mars</h2>
        <p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is a cold, rocky world often called the "Red Planet" due to its iron oxide-rich surface, which gives it a distinctive reddish hue. With a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers, it is roughly half the size of Earth, making it the second smallest planet in the solar system. Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide (95%), with traces of nitrogen and argon, providing little insulation and resulting in surface temperatures ranging from -125°C (-195°F) at the poles to 20°C (68°F) at the equator during the day. The planet experiences intense dust storms, some of which can envelop the entire planet for weeks.

            Mars is home to some of the solar system’s most remarkable geological features, including Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano and mountain, rising about 22 kilometers high, and Valles Marineris, a canyon system over 4,000 kilometers long and up to 7 kilometers deep. Its polar ice caps, composed of water and carbon dioxide ice, expand and contract with the seasons, revealing a dynamic climate influenced by its axial tilt of 25.2 degrees. Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos, thought to be captured asteroids.
            
            Evidence from rovers and orbiters suggests that Mars once had a warmer, wetter climate, with rivers, lakes, and perhaps an ocean billions of years ago. This has fueled interest in the potential for past life on Mars and the ongoing search for microbial life. Robotic missions, including NASA’s Perseverance rover and the Ingenuity helicopter, are exploring its surface, while future plans aim for human exploration. As a potential site for human colonization and a natural laboratory for studying planetary evolution, Mars holds a special place in the quest to understand the past and future of our solar system.</p>

        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <p>Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, is the largest planet in the solar system, a gas giant of immense size and mass that dominates its celestial neighborhood. With a diameter of approximately 139,820 kilometers, it is 11 times wider than Earth and has over 300 times its mass, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total planetary mass in the solar system. Composed primarily of hydrogen (about 90%) and helium (about 10%), Jupiter lacks a solid surface and features a thick atmosphere marked by turbulent weather systems, including the iconic Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than Earth that has raged for at least 350 years.

            Jupiter's rapid rotation, completing a day in just under 10 hours, flattens its poles and generates powerful magnetic fields, the strongest of any planet. These magnetic fields create spectacular auroras at its poles and trap intense radiation belts. Its atmosphere, organized into bands of colorful clouds, exhibits dynamic weather patterns driven by heat from its interior, which emits more energy than it receives from the Sun.
            
            The planet is surrounded by a faint ring system and is orbited by 95 known moons, including the four large Galilean moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Each of these moons is unique: Io is volcanically active, Europa is covered in ice and may harbor a subsurface ocean, Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, and Callisto has a heavily cratered surface.
            
            Jupiter’s immense gravitational influence has shaped the evolution of the solar system, capturing asteroids and comets and protecting the inner planets from frequent impacts. Robotic missions like NASA's Juno are studying its atmosphere, magnetic field, and interior structure to uncover clues about the early solar system's formation. As a massive and dynamic world, Jupiter continues to intrigue scientists and remains a cornerstone in the study of planetary science.</p>

        <h2>Saturn</h2>
        <p>Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is a gas giant renowned for its breathtaking ring system, the most extensive and complex in the solar system. With a diameter of approximately 120,536 kilometers, it is the second-largest planet, over nine times wider than Earth, but its mass is primarily hydrogen and helium, making it the least dense planet—it could theoretically float in water. Saturn’s atmosphere, composed mostly of hydrogen (about 96%) and helium (about 3%), features bands of clouds and periodic storms, with winds reaching speeds of up to 1,800 kilometers per hour (1,118 miles per hour).

            The planet's iconic rings are made up of billions of ice particles, ranging from microscopic grains to chunks several meters across, organized into seven distinct bands separated by gaps. These rings are thought to be remnants of comets, asteroids, or moons torn apart by Saturn's powerful gravity. Saturn completes one rotation in just 10.7 hours, giving it a slightly flattened appearance due to its rapid spin, and it takes about 29.5 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun.
            
            Saturn hosts a remarkable collection of 146 confirmed moons, with Titan and Enceladus being the most notable. Titan, the largest, has a thick atmosphere and surface lakes of liquid methane and ethane, while Enceladus has geysers ejecting water vapor, suggesting the presence of a subsurface ocean that could potentially harbor life. Saturn's magnetic field, though weaker than Jupiter's, generates auroras at its poles and contributes to the dynamics of its rings and moons.
            
            Missions like NASA's Cassini spacecraft have provided invaluable insights into Saturn’s atmosphere, rings, and moons, revealing it as a complex and dynamic system. Saturn’s beauty and scientific intrigue make it a centerpiece for understanding the processes that shape giant planets and their intricate systems in the solar system and beyond.</p>

        <h2>Uranus</h2>
        <p>Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is a unique and enigmatic world, often referred to as an "ice giant" due to its composition and distinct characteristics. With a diameter of approximately 50,724 kilometers, Uranus is the third-largest planet in the solar system, about four times wider than Earth. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen (83%) and helium (15%), with a significant proportion of methane (2%), which absorbs red light and gives the planet its striking blue-green color. Beneath the atmosphere lies a dense, icy mantle of water, ammonia, and methane, surrounding a rocky core.

            Uranus is notable for its extreme axial tilt of 98 degrees, causing it to rotate almost completely on its side relative to its orbit. This unique orientation results in unusual seasonal patterns, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness. A day on Uranus lasts about 17 hours, while a year takes 84 Earth years. The planet's magnetic field is equally peculiar, tilted significantly from its rotational axis and offset from its center, creating complex and asymmetrical auroras.
            
            Surrounded by a faint ring system composed of dark, narrow bands of particles and 27 known moons, Uranus has a diverse and fascinating system. Its largest moons—Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda—show varied geological features, including canyons, craters, and icy surfaces, hinting at past tectonic and possibly cryovolcanic activity.
            
            The planet’s cold temperatures, averaging around -224°C (-371°F), make it the coldest in the solar system, likely due to its limited internal heat. Uranus has been explored up close only once, by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986, but future missions are being considered to further study its unique attributes. As a distant, tilted, and icy world, Uranus offers a wealth of mysteries about planetary formation, magnetic fields, and the outer solar system..</p>

        <h2>Neptune</h2>
        <p>Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, is a strikingly beautiful and dynamic world known for its deep blue color, caused by the absorption of red light by methane in its atmosphere. With a diameter of about 49,244 kilometers, Neptune is slightly smaller than Uranus but is more massive, making it the densest of the gas giants. Like Uranus, Neptune is classified as an "ice giant" due to its composition, which includes a significant amount of water, ammonia, and methane ice in its atmosphere and mantle, surrounding a rocky core. The planet's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with methane playing a critical role in shaping its appearance.

            One of Neptune's most remarkable features is its intense weather systems, including the fastest winds in the solar system, which can reach speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour (1,300 miles per hour). These winds fuel massive storms, including the Great Dark Spot, a large storm system similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, although it appears to change position and size over time. Neptune's atmosphere also exhibits striking cloud formations, with high-altitude methane clouds casting shadows on the planet’s deeper layers. Despite being so far from the Sun, Neptune radiates more heat than it receives, likely due to internal processes that remain a mystery.
            
            Neptune has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and most fascinating. Triton is unique in that it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation, a phenomenon known as retrograde motion. It is also geologically active, with geysers that eject nitrogen gas into space, suggesting a subsurface ocean. The planet also has a faint ring system, composed of dark and narrow rings that were discovered in 1984.
            
            Neptune's orbit takes about 165 Earth years to complete, and a day on Neptune lasts just about 16 hours. Though it was visited by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, Neptune remains a relatively unexplored world, and future missions are anticipated to provide further insights into its atmosphere, moons, and the peculiarities of its position at the outer reaches of the solar system. As the most distant planet, Neptune holds many secrets about the formation and behavior of icy planets and the nature of the solar system's outer frontier.</p>
